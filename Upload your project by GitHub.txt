Upload your project by using GitHub best practices

apenas um teste para fazer o exercicio!



The following activity provides instructions to move your local project to GitHub using various tools:

**Using the command line
1.In your command line, navigate to your project directory. Type git init to initialize the directory as a Git repository.
2.Type git remote add origin https://github.com/Eduardo-RomeroKM/github-upload.git
3.Type git add .
4.Type git commit -m "initializing repository"
5.Type git push -u origin main to push the files you have locally to the remote on GitHub. (You may be asked to log in.)



**Using GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop doesn't allow you to add a new remote for an existing directory, so instead we'll copy the contents of your existing folder 
to our repo. If you'd like to keep your existing folder, you may want to use the command line or one of the other tools.

1.In GitHub Desktop, click on File and Clone a repository.
2.Click on the URL tab.
3.Paste the URL from this repository.
4.Move the contents of your local repository to this directory.
5.Create a commit by entering a commit message and then clicking on Commit to main
6.Click Publish branch in the top right corner to push your repository to GitHub.



**Using Visual Studio Code
1.In Visual Studio Code, open the folder for your project.
2.Click the icon on the left for Source Control.
3.On the top of the Source Control panel, click the Git icon.
4.If the files you see match the repository you want to create, click Initialize Repository.
5.Next to the word CHANGES, click the symbol of the plus sign to stage all of the changes.
	-This is part of the two stage commit. You can use this staging function to create meaningful commits throughout the development process.
6.In the box in the Source Control panel, type a commit message. Something like "initial commit - moving project" could work.
7.Click the checkmark at the top of the Source Control panel.
8.Open the integrated terminal found under View > Integrated Terminal.
9.In your command line, type git remote add origin https://github.com/Eduardo-RomeroKM/github-upload
10.In the Source Control Panel, click the expandable three dots that open a menu of options.
11.When asked if you'd like to publish the branch, click Okay.
